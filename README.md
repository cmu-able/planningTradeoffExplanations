# Supplementary Material for Explaining Quality Attribute Tradeoffs in Automated Planning for Self-Adaptive Systems

For the analysis, the main script is [R_script.Rmd](R_script.Rmd).
* It uses the util scripts in [scripts](/scripts) and the example data csv files in [example_data](/example_data).
* You can find example plots in the [plots](/plots) folder.

The generated plots can be used to explain quality attribute tradeoffs. 
Concretely, they show a PCA biplot of the data, an MCA biplot, several joint dimension reduction and clustering plots based on [clustrd](https://github.com/amarkos/clustrd), and decision tree plots.

For the policy generation, you can find additional instructions in the [XPlanning](/XPlanning) folder.
