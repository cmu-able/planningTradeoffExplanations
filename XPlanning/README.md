To run MobileRobotDemo:

- Compile MobileRobotXPlanner.java under /XPlanning/src/examples/mobilerobot/demo/.

- The mission files are located under /XPlanning/data/mobilerobot/missions/. Each missionX.json references a corresponding mapX.json under /XPlanning/data/mobilerobot/maps/.

- Once the MobileRobot's execution completes, it will generate several output files under /XPlanning/tmpdata/. A CSV file is generated that includes one row per generated policy (including the utility function weights, the costs, and the policy actions).
