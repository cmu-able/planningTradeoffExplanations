{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling0\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling0\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 16.872396060141597 dollars in revenue (103.12760393985836 in cost); have 0.0 dollar in idle time cost (0.0 in cost); have 1.1016798465546929 dollars in overtime cost (1.1016798465546929 in cost); have 0.0 dollar in appointment lead time cost (0.0 in cost); and have 0.0 dollar in switching ABP cost (0.0 in cost) per day on average. It has the lowest expected idle time cost, appointment lead time cost, and switching ABP cost; and has the highest expected revenue.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling0\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the overtime cost to 1.0906630480891457 dollars in overtime cost (-0.01101679846554715 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would reduce the revenue to 16.858202819085246 dollars in revenue (+0.014193241056290162 in cost). The decrease in overtime cost is not worth the decrease in revenue.","Mission":"scheduling0","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling0\/altPolicy1.json"]}
