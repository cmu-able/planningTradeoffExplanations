{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling1\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling1\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 48.50150318891782 dollars in revenue (251.4984968110821 in cost); have 0.0 dollar in idle time cost (0.0 in cost); have 3.3315046971919062 dollars in overtime cost (3.3315046971919062 in cost); have 0.0 dollar in appointment lead time cost (0.0 in cost); and have 0.0 dollar in switching ABP cost (0.0 in cost) per day on average. It has the lowest expected switching ABP cost, appointment lead time cost, and idle time cost.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling1\/altPolicy1.json] would increase the revenue to 48.986518220807 dollars in revenue (-0.48501503188910533 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the overtime cost to 3.930580850179326 dollars in overtime cost (+0.5990761529874198 in cost). The increase in revenue is not worth the increase in overtime cost.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling1\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the overtime cost to 3.298189650219985 dollars in overtime cost (-0.03331504697192145 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would reduce the revenue to 48.46686584678545 dollars in revenue (+0.03463734221247705 in cost). The decrease in overtime cost is not worth the decrease in revenue.","Mission":"scheduling1","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling1\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling1\/altPolicy2.json"]}
