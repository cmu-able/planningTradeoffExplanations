{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling2\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling2\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 48.50150318891784 dollars in revenue (251.49849681108222 in cost); have 0.0 dollar in idle time cost (0.0 in cost); have 3.3315046971919067 dollars in overtime cost (3.3315046971919067 in cost); have 0.5000000000000001 dollar in appointment lead time cost (0.5000000000000001 in cost); and have 0.0 dollar in switching ABP cost (0.0 in cost) per day on average. It has the lowest expected switching ABP cost, appointment lead time cost, and idle time cost.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling2\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the overtime cost to 3.2981896502199874 dollars in overtime cost (-0.03331504697191923 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would reduce the revenue to 48.46686584677344 dollars in revenue (+0.03463734214432179 in cost). The decrease in overtime cost is not worth the decrease in revenue.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling2\/altPolicy2.json] would increase the revenue to 48.986518220807014 dollars in revenue (-0.4850150318893043 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the overtime cost to 3.930580850179342 dollars in overtime cost (+0.5990761529874353 in cost). The increase in revenue is not worth the increase in overtime cost.","Mission":"scheduling2","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling2\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling2\/altPolicy2.json"]}
