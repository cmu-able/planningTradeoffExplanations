{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling3\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling3\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 48.50150318891778 dollars in revenue (251.49849681108205 in cost); have 0.0 dollar in idle time cost (0.0 in cost); have 3.3315046971919045 dollars in overtime cost (3.3315046971919045 in cost); have 2.4999999999999987 dollars in appointment lead time cost (2.4999999999999987 in cost); and have 0.0 dollar in switching ABP cost (0.0 in cost) per day on average. It has the lowest expected switching ABP cost, idle time cost, and appointment lead time cost.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling3\/altPolicy1.json] would increase the revenue to 48.98651822080696 dollars in revenue (-0.485015031894676 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the overtime cost to 3.9305808501803527 dollars in overtime cost (+0.5990761529884483 in cost). The increase in revenue is not worth the increase in overtime cost.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling3\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the overtime cost to 3.298189650219985 dollars in overtime cost (-0.03331504697191967 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would reduce the revenue to 48.46686584677345 dollars in revenue (+0.03463734214457759 in cost). The decrease in overtime cost is not worth the decrease in revenue.","Mission":"scheduling3","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling3\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling3\/altPolicy2.json"]}
