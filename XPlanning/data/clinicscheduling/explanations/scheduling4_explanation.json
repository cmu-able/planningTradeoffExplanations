{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling4\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling4\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 43.71994719257086 dollars in revenue (256.28005280742923 in cost); have 11.872394155555607 dollars in idle time cost (11.872394155555607 in cost); have 1.4675004199250636 dollars in overtime cost (1.4675004199250636 in cost); have 0.0 dollar in appointment lead time cost (0.0 in cost); and have 0.0 dollar in switching ABP cost (0.0 in cost) per day on average. It has the lowest expected switching ABP cost, and appointment lead time cost.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling4\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the idle time cost to 11.745543292912176 dollars in idle time cost (-0.12685086264343148 in cost), and reduce the overtime cost to 1.459490388737477 dollars in overtime cost (-0.008010031187586586 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would reduce the revenue to 43.570841254994114 dollars in revenue (+0.1491059357267659 in cost). The decrease in idle time cost, and the decrease in overtime cost are not worth the decrease in revenue.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling4\/altPolicy2.json] would increase the revenue to 44.15714666449658 dollars in revenue (-0.43719947192582254 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the idle time cost to 12.222106918477529 dollars in idle time cost (+0.34971276292192144 in cost), and increase the overtime cost to 1.6179518365163352 dollars in overtime cost (+0.1504514165912716 in cost). The increase in revenue is not worth the increase in idle time cost, and the increase in overtime cost.","Mission":"scheduling4","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling4\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling4\/altPolicy2.json"]}
