{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling5\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling5\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 43.71994719257085 dollars in revenue (256.2800528074291 in cost); have 11.872394155555606 dollars in idle time cost (11.872394155555606 in cost); have 1.4675004199250632 dollars in overtime cost (1.4675004199250632 in cost); have 0.5246944390028946 dollar in appointment lead time cost (0.5246944390028946 in cost); and have 0.0 dollar in switching ABP cost (0.0 in cost) per day on average. It has the lowest expected switching ABP cost.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling5\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the appointment lead time cost to 0.5159857417413541 dollar in appointment lead time cost (-0.008708697261540443 in cost), and increase the revenue to 43.81862725578483 dollars in revenue (-0.09868006321391931 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the idle time cost to 11.898108295890006 dollars in idle time cost (+0.02571414033440078 in cost), and increase the overtime cost to 1.5599262274045458 dollars in overtime cost (+0.09242580747948259 in cost). The decrease in appointment lead time cost, and the increase in revenue are not worth the increase in idle time cost, and the increase in overtime cost.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling5\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the idle time cost to 11.745543292987863 dollars in idle time cost (-0.1268508625677427 in cost), and reduce the overtime cost to 1.4594903887468829 dollars in overtime cost (-0.008010031178180332 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the appointment lead time cost to 0.5263317983494374 dollar in appointment lead time cost (+0.0016373593465428549 in cost), and reduce the revenue to 43.570841255274885 dollars in revenue (+0.14910593737920408 in cost). The decrease in idle time cost, and the decrease in overtime cost are not worth the increase in appointment lead time cost, and the decrease in revenue.","Mission":"scheduling5","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling5\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling5\/altPolicy2.json"]}
