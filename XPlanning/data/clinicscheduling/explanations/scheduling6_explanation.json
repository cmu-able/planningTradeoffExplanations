{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling6\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling6\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 43.96973022903724 dollars in revenue (256.03026977096255 in cost); have 11.941223574303601 dollars in idle time cost (11.941223574303601 in cost); have 1.7074448331586236 dollars in overtime cost (1.7074448331586236 in cost); have 2.4999999999999987 dollars in appointment lead time cost (2.4999999999999987 in cost); and have 0.0 dollar in switching ABP cost (0.0 in cost) per day on average. It has the lowest expected switching ABP cost, and appointment lead time cost.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling6\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the idle time cost to 11.821811338560568 dollars in idle time cost (-0.11941223574303272 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the overtime cost to 1.7141387483308468 dollars in overtime cost (+0.006693915172223175 in cost), and reduce the revenue to 43.83921443252119 dollars in revenue (+0.13051579651613565 in cost). The decrease in idle time cost is not worth the increase in overtime cost, and the decrease in revenue.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling6\/altPolicy2.json] would increase the revenue to 44.409427531327616 dollars in revenue (-0.4396973022901989 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the idle time cost to 12.408777491409806 dollars in idle time cost (+0.46755391710620486 in cost), and increase the overtime cost to 1.742744710079439 dollars in overtime cost (+0.03529987692081549 in cost). The increase in revenue is not worth the increase in idle time cost, and the increase in overtime cost.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling6\/altPolicy3.json] would reduce the idle time cost to 11.915592013605307 dollars in idle time cost (-0.025631560698293754 in cost), and reduce the overtime cost to 1.6903703848270377 dollars in overtime cost (-0.01707444833158589 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would reduce the revenue to 43.918426167447635 dollars in revenue (+0.05130406158991718 in cost). The decrease in idle time cost, and the decrease in overtime cost are not worth the decrease in revenue.","Mission":"scheduling6","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling6\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling6\/altPolicy2.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling6\/altPolicy3.json"]}
