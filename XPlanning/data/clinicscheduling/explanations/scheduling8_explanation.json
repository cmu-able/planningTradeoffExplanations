{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling8\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling8\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 dollar in revenue (0.0 in cost); have 7.86158031536284 dollars in idle time cost (7.86158031536284 in cost); have 0.40388486290635384 dollar in overtime cost (0.40388486290635384 in cost); have 0.5639086215152105 dollar in appointment lead time cost (0.5639086215152105 in cost); and have 0.0 dollar in switching ABP cost (0.0 in cost) per day on average. It has the lowest expected switching ABP cost; and has the highest expected revenue.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling8\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the overtime cost to 0.39984601427729044 dollar in overtime cost (-0.004038848629063396 in cost), and reduce the appointment lead time cost to 0.5630831286834009 dollar in appointment lead time cost (-8.254928318095489E-4 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the idle time cost to 7.887627408739358 dollars in idle time cost (+0.026047093376518227 in cost). The decrease in overtime cost, and the decrease in appointment lead time cost are not worth the increase in idle time cost.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling8\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the idle time cost to 7.782964512209212 dollars in idle time cost (-0.07861580315362815 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the overtime cost to 0.4433317357781797 dollar in overtime cost (+0.039446872871825855 in cost), and increase the appointment lead time cost to 0.6197654658884152 dollar in appointment lead time cost (+0.055856844373204706 in cost). The decrease in idle time cost is not worth the increase in overtime cost, and the increase in appointment lead time cost.","Mission":"scheduling8","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling8\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling8\/altPolicy2.json"]}
