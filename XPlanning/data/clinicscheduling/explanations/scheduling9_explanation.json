{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling9\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling9\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to have 0.0 dollar in revenue (0.0 in cost); have 7.861580315362795 dollars in idle time cost (7.861580315362795 in cost); have 0.4038848629063517 dollar in overtime cost (0.4038848629063517 in cost); have 2.819543107576037 dollars in appointment lead time cost (2.819543107576037 in cost); and have 0.0 dollar in switching ABP cost (0.0 in cost) per day on average. It has the lowest expected switching ABP cost; and has the highest expected revenue.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling9\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the overtime cost to 0.3998460142772876 dollar in overtime cost (-0.004038848629064118 in cost), and reduce the appointment lead time cost to 2.8153766163357403 dollars in appointment lead time cost (-0.004166491240296555 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the idle time cost to 7.887639710237094 dollars in idle time cost (+0.026059394874299535 in cost). The decrease in overtime cost, and the decrease in appointment lead time cost are not worth the increase in idle time cost.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling9\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the idle time cost to 7.782964512209165 dollars in idle time cost (-0.07861580315362993 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the overtime cost to 0.44333173574924484 dollar in overtime cost (+0.03944687284289311 in cost), and increase the appointment lead time cost to 3.098827329237484 dollars in appointment lead time cost (+0.27928422166144706 in cost). The decrease in idle time cost is not worth the increase in overtime cost, and the increase in appointment lead time cost.","Mission":"scheduling9","Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling9\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/scheduling9\/altPolicy2.json"]}
