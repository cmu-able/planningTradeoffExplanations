{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission2\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission2\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to miss 0.515625 expected target (0.2578125 in cost); and have 0.03125 probaility of being destroyed (0.015625 in cost). It has the lowest expected expected number of targets missed.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected probability of being destroyed by 0.015625000000048697 (-0.007812500000024349 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected expected number of targets missed by 0.23828124999998812 (+0.11914062499999406 in cost). The decrease in expected probability of being destroyed is not worth the increase in expected expected number of targets missed.","solnPolicy.json":{"missTarget":"0.515625","destroyedProbability":"0.03125"},"Mission":"mission2.txt","altPolicy1.json":{"missTarget":"0.7539062499999881","destroyedProbability":"0.015624999999951303"},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission2\/altPolicy1.json"]}
