It is expected to miss 1.0 expected target (0.5 in cost); and have 0.0 probaility of being destroyed (0.0 in cost). It has the lowest expected probability of being destroyed.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission3\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected expected number of targets missed by 0.015625 (-0.0078125 in cost). It would also increase the expected probability of being destroyed by 0.015625 (+0.0078125 in cost). The objective function is indifferent between this alternative and the solution policy.","solnPolicy.json":{"missTarget":"1.0","destroyedProbability":"0.0"},"Mission":"mission3.txt","altPolicy1.json":{"missTarget":"0.984375","destroyedProbability":"0.015625"},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission3\/altPolicy1.json"]}
