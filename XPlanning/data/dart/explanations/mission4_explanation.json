{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission4\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission4\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to miss 0.25 expected target (0.125 in cost); and have 0.09398496240601503 probaility of being destroyed (0.046992481203007516 in cost). It has the lowest expected expected number of targets missed.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission4\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected probability of being destroyed by 0.04699248120301503 (-0.023496240601507516 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected expected number of targets missed by 0.12500000000043748 (+0.06250000000021874 in cost). The decrease in expected probability of being destroyed is not worth the increase in expected expected number of targets missed.","solnPolicy.json":{"missTarget":"0.25","destroyedProbability":"0.09398496240601503"},"Mission":"mission4.txt","altPolicy1.json":{"missTarget":"0.3750000000004375","destroyedProbability":"0.046992481203"},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission4\/altPolicy1.json"]}
