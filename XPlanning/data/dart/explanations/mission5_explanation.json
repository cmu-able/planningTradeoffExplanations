{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission5\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission5\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to miss 0.32048872180451127 expected target (0.16024436090225563 in cost); and have 0.09398496240601503 probaility of being destroyed (0.046992481203007516 in cost). It has the lowest expected expected number of targets missed.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission5\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected probability of being destroyed by 0.023496240601802207 (-0.011748120300901103 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected expected number of targets missed by 0.09856672932312194 (+0.04928336466156097 in cost). The decrease in expected probability of being destroyed is not worth the increase in expected expected number of targets missed.","solnPolicy.json":{"missTarget":"0.32048872180451127","destroyedProbability":"0.09398496240601503"},"Mission":"mission5.txt","altPolicy1.json":{"missTarget":"0.4190554511276332","destroyedProbability":"0.07048872180421283"},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission5\/altPolicy1.json"]}
