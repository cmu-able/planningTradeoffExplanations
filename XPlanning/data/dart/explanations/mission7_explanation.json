{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission7\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission7\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to miss 0.75 expected target (0.375 in cost); and have 0.25 probaility of being destroyed (0.125 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission7\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected expected number of targets missed by 0.03195488721799966 (-0.01597744360899983 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected probability of being destroyed by 0.04882624795065721 (+0.024413123975328604 in cost). The decrease in expected expected number of targets missed is not worth the increase in expected probability of being destroyed.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission7\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the expected probability of being destroyed by 0.06203007518795034 (-0.03101503759397517 in cost). It would also increase the expected expected number of targets missed by 0.06203007518821457 (+0.031015037594107286 in cost). The objective function is indifferent between this alternative and the solution policy.","solnPolicy.json":{"missTarget":"0.75","destroyedProbability":"0.25"},"Mission":"mission7.txt","altPolicy1.json":{"missTarget":"0.7180451127820003","destroyedProbability":"0.2988262479506572"},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission7\/altPolicy1.json","\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission7\/altPolicy2.json"],"altPolicy2.json":{"missTarget":"0.8120300751882146","destroyedProbability":"0.18796992481204966"}}
