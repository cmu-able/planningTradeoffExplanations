It is expected to miss 1.2265037593984962 expected targets (0.6132518796992481 in cost); and have 0.09398496240601503 probaility of being destroyed (0.046992481203007516 in cost).\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission9\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected expected number of targets missed by 0.015566259399642846 (-0.007783129699821423 in cost). However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected probability of being destroyed by 0.062265037593837 (+0.0311325187969185 in cost). The decrease in expected expected number of targets missed is not worth the increase in expected probability of being destroyed.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanning\/tmpdata\/policies\/mission9\/altPolicy2.json] would reduce the expected probability of being destroyed by 0.023496240601802207 (-0.011748120300901103 in cost).
