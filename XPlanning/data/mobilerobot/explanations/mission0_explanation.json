{"Solution Policy":"\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission0\/solnPolicy.json","Explanation":"I'm planning to follow this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission0\/solnPolicy.json]. It is expected to take 166 seconds; have 0 expected collision; and have intrusiveness-penalty of 10: it will be non-intrusive at 8 locations (0-penalty), somewhat-intrusive at 1 location (1-penalty), and very-intrusive at 3 locations (9-penalty). It has the lowest expected collision, and intrusiveness.\n\nAlternatively, following this policy [\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission0\/altPolicy1.json] would reduce the expected travel time by 17 seconds. However, I didn't choose that policy because it would increase the expected collision by 0.2. The decrease in expected travel time is not worth the increase in expected collision.","solnPolicy.json":{"collision":"0","travelTime":"166","intrusiveness":{"Value":"10","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"8","very-intrusive":"3","somewhat-intrusive":"1"}}},"Mission":"mission0.json","altPolicy1.json":{"collision":"0.2","travelTime":"149","intrusiveness":{"Value":"10","Event-based Values":{"non-intrusive":"8","very-intrusive":"3","somewhat-intrusive":"1"}}},"Alternative Policies":["\/Users\/rsukkerd\/Projects\/explainable-planning\/XPlanningEvaluation\/output\/policies\/mission0\/altPolicy1.json"]}
